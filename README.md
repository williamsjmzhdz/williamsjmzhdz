Full Stack Developer
--------------------

Hello, I'm Francisco Williams Jiménez Hernández, an aspiring software developer and a dedicated student of Computer Engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. My passion for technology drives my ambition, and I'm eagerly looking forward to expanding my expertise with a Diploma in Systems Development with Java Technology, slated to commence next year. 

My journey in the tech world has been marked by a significant internship at the Engineering Institute, UNAM, where I developed and maintained web applications using JavaScript and Python technologies. This experience not only honed my programming skills but also nurtured my problem-solving capabilities, allowing me to innovate and find efficient solutions to complex challenges. 

Leadership and teamwork are core aspects of my professional ethos. I've had the privilege of leading diverse teams and contributing to projects, which enhanced my ability to work effectively in multicultural environments. During my social service stint at the Engineering Institute, UNAM, I further developed my front-end development skills, particularly in Django/Python and JavaScript, ensuring adaptive and user-friendly web experiences. 

I take pride in my personal projects, 'Forkify' and 'Omnifood', where I've applied my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create responsive and engaging web applications. These projects were not just a display of my technical abilities but also a testament to my commitment to modern web design and project management. 

Fluent in Spanish and proficient in English, I am well-prepared to engage in diverse international settings. My technical toolkit is continually expanding, encompassing a range of development tools and frameworks. 

In essence, I am a tech enthusiast, eager to explore new challenges and driven to make a significant impact in the world of digital technology
